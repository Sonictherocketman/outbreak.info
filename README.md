# outbreak.info
During outbreaks of emerging diseases such as COVID-19, efficiently collecting, sharing, and integrating data is critical to scientific research.

outbreak.info is a project from the [Su lab](http://sulab.org/) at Scripps Research to aggregate all this information into a single location.

*Disclaimer: This project is a work-in progress. Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/SuLab/outbreak.info/issues) if you notice any bugs or want to suggest features.*
